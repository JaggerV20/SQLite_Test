# SQLite_Test

7/13/24

I want to practice using SQL. From what I can tell, SQL is not integrated with git. To work around this, I will be using
SQLite and uploading the database file and test scripts. Revision notes will be included here.

The database will be a recipe database for the game Touhou Mystia's Izakaya. Scripts will construct the database and
query the database.
